This (New)TinyRadius project was created primarily to enable the TinyRadius
RADIUS server to be multi-threaded.

This (New)TinyRadius project is derived from https://github.com/dlad/TinyRadius
which (I think) was derived from the original TinyRadius at
http://tinyradius.sourceforge.net/ to fix some bugs (like issues with long passwords)


======  Original TinyRadius README ======
TinyRadius README

TinyRadius is a simple, small and fast Java Radius library capable of
sending and receiving Radius packets of all types. It is released
under the terms of the LGPL.

For documentation, please have a look at doc/tinyradius.html
and doc/apidoc. Every method has got JavaDoc comments, and every
package has got a package.html document detailing the package
usage.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have got questions or
suggestions.
